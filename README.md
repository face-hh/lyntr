# Self-host
First, we need to setup the `.env` file with the right secrets.
- Rename `.env.example` to `.env`

## Supabase
Firstly we have to setup the database. Head to https://supabase.com and **create an account.**

![New project](github-assets/supabase1.png)

Now, click **"New project"**.

![New project - 2](github-assets/supabase2.png)


For the **project name**, choose whatever name you wish.
For the **database password**, you could generate a random password or input yours. **Make sure to save it.**
For the **region**, choose the region closer to your machine.

Then click **Create new project**. It will take a few minutes, so in the meantime you can copy the secrets.

![New project - 3](github-assets/supabase3.png)
On this page we can see the **Project API keys** and **Project configuration** sections.

- Copy the `anon public` secret and put it in your `.env`:
```python
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="ey........................"
```
- Copy the `Project Configuration` > `URL`:
```python
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="https://.....supabase.co"
```
- Copy the `Project Configuration` > `JWT Secret`:
```python
JWT_SECRET="..........x............x........."
```

![New project - 4](github-assets/supabase4.png)
Now that the Database has been created, click **"Connect"**.
![New project - 5](github-assets/supabase5.png)
Copy the URL and put it in your `.env`:
```python
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres.USERNAME:PASSWORD/options"
```
If you clicked `Copy` on the Connect page, you should already have the `USERNAME`. Simply replace `PASSWORD` with the one you put at:
> For the **database password**, you could generate a random password or input yours. **Make sure to save it.**

Now simply split the `DATABASE_URL` components:
```python
DB_HOST="LOCATION.pooler.supabase.com" # Change "LOCATION"
DB_USER="postgres.USERNAME" # Change "USERNAME"
DB_PASSWORD="PASSWORD" # Change "PASSWORD"
DB_NAME="postgres" # Can be left like this
```
![New project - 6](github-assets/supabase6.png)

Now run the following:
```bash
npx drizzle-kit generate
npx drizzle-kit migrate
npx drizzle-kit push
```

And follow [this guide on how to enable the Discord auth in Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-discord), until the code part. It should look something like this.

## MinIO
We need Min.io for images. This and the next step can be omitted if you don't need *Image support* / *reporting*.

### Setup
Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and run the following command:
```bash
MINIO_USER=admin MINIO_PASS=admin docker compose up --build -d
```
‚Äº This may fail if you haven't followed the Supabase step properly (because the `compose.yml` file also starts Lyntr in production at 5999 port.)

After that's done, navigate to `https://localhost:9001`. You will see this.

![MinIO - 1](github-assets/minio1.png)
If you followed the Docker command properly, the username and password should both be `admin`. Log in.

![MinIO - 2](github-assets/minio2.png)
Create a bucket.

![MinIO - 3](github-assets/minio3.png)
Input a bucket name and click Create Bucket.

And change the `.env`:
```python
S3_BUCKET_NAME="the_name_you_chose"
```

![MinIO - 4](github-assets/minio4.png)
Now navigate to **"Access Keys"** and click **"Create Access key"**
![MinIO - 4](github-assets/minio4.png)
Simply copy the **Access key** and **Secret key** and update your `.env` accordingly:
```python
MINIO_ACCESS_KEY="first_field"
MINIO_SECRET_KEY="second_field"
```
Then click "Create".

### Great, now we have to make the bucket public so we can access it at `http://localhost:9000/lyntr/` without a token.

Run this:
```bash
docker exec -it minio sh -c "mc alias set myminio http://localhost:9000 "admin" "admin" && mc anonymous set public myminio/lyntr"
```

And you're good to go! You can now simply go to `http://localhost:5999` to access Lyntr locally, or run `npm i && npm run dev` in your terminal for dev mode and access it at `http://localhost:5173/`.

If you wish to get Reporting to work, follow the last step.

## Discord
- [Create a Discord bot](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html) and copy the token.
- Create a Discord server and invite the bot there.
- Create a Channel and copy its ID.
- Create a Role, give it to yourself, and copy its ID.

Now update the `.env`:
```python
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="discord.token.here"
DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID="channel.id.here"
ADMIN_KEY="can.be.anything.just.make.sure.its.secure"
SUDO_USER_ID="your.lyntr.account.id" # Create a Lyntr account and copy its ID. If this field won't be filled, your bot will fail to fetch `api/lynt` at GET for info on report. Check the Network tab for the `api/me` request and copy the ID it returns.

DISCORD_ADMIN_ROLE="your.admin.role"
```
